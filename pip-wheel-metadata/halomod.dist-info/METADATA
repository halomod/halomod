``halomod`` is a python application that provides a flexible and simple interface for
dealing with the Halo Model of Dark Matter Halos, built on `hmf <https://github.com/steven-murray/hmf>`_.



Features
--------
* All the features of ``hmf`` (several transfer function models, 15+ HMF fitting functions,
  efficient caching etc.)
* Extended components for halo model:

  * 10 **halo bias** models, plus scale-dependent bias from Tinker (2005).
  * 3 basic **concentration-mass-redshift relations**, including the analytic Bullock (2001) model
  * Several plug-and-play **halo-exclusion** models (including ng-matched from Tinker+2005).
  * 5 built-in **HOD parametrisations**.
  * Many built-in **halo profiles**, including NFW, generalised NFW, Hernquist etc.
  * Support for **WDM models**.

* All basic quantities such as 3D correlations and power spectra, and projected 2PCF.
* Several derived quantities (eg. effective bias, satellite fraction).
* All models/components specifically written to be easily extendable.
* Simple routine for populating a halo catalogue with galaxies via a HOD.
* Built-in routines for efficient fitting of arbitrary parameters to data. **BETA**
* CLI scripts both for producing any quantity included, or fitting any quantity. **BETA**

Usage
-----
``halomod`` can be used interactively (for instance in ``ipython`` or a ``jupyter`` notebook)
or in a script.
To use interactively, in ``ipython`` do something like the following::

    >>> from src.halomod import HaloModel
    >>> hm = HaloModel()  # Construct the object
    >>> help(hm)          # Lists many of the available quantities.
    >>> galcorr = hm.corr_auto_tracer
    >>> bias = hm.bias
    >>> ...

All parameters to ``HaloModel`` have defaults so none need to be specified. There are
quite a few that *can* be specified however. Check the docstring to see the
details. Furthermore, as ``halomod`` extends the functionality of
`hmf <https://github.com/steven-murray/hmf>`_, almost all parameters accepted by
``hmf.MassFunction()`` can be used (check its docstring).

To change the parameters (cosmological or otherwise), one should use the
``update()`` method, if a ``HaloModel()`` object already exists. For example

>>> hm.update(rmin=0.1,rmax=1.0,rnum=100) #update scale vector
>>> corr_2h = hm.corr_2h_auto_tracer #The 2-halo term of the galaxy correlation function

Since ``HaloModel`` is a sub-class of ``MassFunction``, all the quantities associated
with the hmf are also included, so for example

>>> mass_variance = hm.sigma
>>> mass_function = hm.dndm
>>> linear_power = hm.power

Any parameter which defines a model choice (eg. a bias model) is named ``<component>_model``,
so for example, the bias model is called ``bias_model``. *Every* model has an associated
parameter called ``<component>_params``, which is a dictionary of parameters to that
model. The available choices for this dictionary depend on the model chosen (so that the
Sheth-Tormen HMF has a different set of parameters than does the Tinker+2008 model).
Within the constructed object, the actual model is instantiated and saved as
``<component>``, so that this object can be accessed, and several internal methods can
be called. *Some* of these are exposed directly by the ``HaloModel`` class (eg. one can
call ``hm.n_sat`` directly, which itself calls a method of the ``hm.hod`` component).
